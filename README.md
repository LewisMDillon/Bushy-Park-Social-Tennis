# BUSHY PARK SOCIAL TENNIS

The Bushy Park Social Tennis website is a site that informs visitors about Bushy Park Social Tennis. The site is targeted primarily towards would-be customers of Bushy Park Social Tennis. Users of the site will be able to see an overview of what the Social Tennis is, as well as learn more details about the sessions including times, prices etc. 

The site gives viewers a snapshot of Social Tennis via the Latest News section and images, and also allows users to sign up to Social Tennis via a signup form.

## UX

The site was designed with clarity and simplicity in mind. The site attempts to deliver the salient information in a clear and accessible way, without clutter. 

The navigation bar takes the user to all areas of the site and sticks at the top of the page while the user scrolls so that any section of the site is accessible at any time.

Smooth scroll behaviour was used to help to inform the user that scrolling of the site is possible and to give the user a better sense of the full layout of the site as they use the links in the navigation bar.

The form section (form.html) was created as a separate page in order to help the user to focus solely on the details of the form, without the possible distraction of other information on the screen.



### Colour Scheme



The site utilizes mainly neutral colors in textual and image elements with bright contrasting pink elements to draw the user's attention.

Main colors were picked to be roughly "tennis-themed" with neutral blues and greens to blend with tennis court colors.

Colour tools such as https://www.colorhexa.com/ & https://palettegenerator.com/ were used to analyze image color palletes and find contrasting standout colours as well as colors to blend and accent.


- `#ffffff` used for primary text.
- `#da48a4` used for primary highlights.
- `#3a3a3a` used for secondary text.
- `#45677b` used for background color
- `#c7288c` used for accessibility alternative to `#da48a4` where needed

- **Signup Form**

 This form provides new users with a simple way of signing up for Bushy Park Social Tennis. The form is on a separate page to keep the user's focus solely on the form, but retains the same styling as the rest of the site, so as not to feel divorced from the main sections of the site.

 The form asks for all the details required by Bushy Park Social Tennis, and requires the user to fill out all sections. On completion of the form, the user is presented with a simple confirmation page, again retaining the syling of the main site, and after a brief moment, returned to the main site to further explore.
